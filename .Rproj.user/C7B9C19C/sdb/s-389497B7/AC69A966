World, blog'\ncategories: [Hello world, R, Java]\ntags: []\n---\n\n\nEvery book needs a cover, every jar a lid, and every blog a 'hello world' post. This is mine. Hello and welcome to my blog.\n\nWhat kind of posts can you expect to see here? Well, for one, I'm a big fan of R, or more precisely, the [#tidyverse](http://github.com/hadley/tidyverse). As [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham), the high priest of the tidyverse himself, [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3mp9r7/im_hadley_wickham_chief_scientist_at_rstudio_and/cvhl63u)\n\n> If you want to give back, I think writing a blog is a great way. Many of the things that you struggle with will be common problems. Think about how to solve them well and describe your solution to others.\n\n\nSo, a lot of what I hope to be doing here is \"describe [my] solution to others.\" I also hope to write about computer science stuff in general, particularly as it relates to Java (my programming mother tongue!). Finally, I hope to write posts to accompany some of my past and future projects. \n\nSome blog-related credits: This blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](pages.github,com), powered by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), themed by [Lanyon](https://github.com/tummychow/lanyon-hugo), and generated by [blogdown](https://github.com/yihui/blogdown)[^1].\n\n[^1]: [And you can too!](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown) \n\n\n",
