Every book needs a cover, every jar a lid, and every blog a 'hello world' post. This is mine. Hello and welcome to my blog.

What kind of posts can you expect to see here? Well, for one, I'm a big fan of R, or more precisely, the [#tidyverse](http://github.com/hadley/tidyverse). As [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham), the high priest of the tidyverse himself, [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3mp9r7/im_hadley_wickham_chief_scientist_at_rstudio_and/cvhl63u)

> If you want to give back, I think writing a blog is a great way. Many of the things that you struggle with will be common problems. Think about how to solve them well and describe your solution to others.


So, a lot of what I hope to be doing here is "describe [my] solution to others." I also hope to write about computer science stuff in general, particularly as it relates to Java (my programming mother tongue!). Finally, I hope to write posts to accompany some of my past and future projects.
