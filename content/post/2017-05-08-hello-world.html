<p>Every book needs a cover, every jar a lid, and every blog a ‘hello world’ post. This is mine. Hello and welcome to my blog.</p>
<p>What kind of posts can you expect to see here? Well, for one, I’m a big fan of R, or more precisely, the <a href="http://github.com/hadley/tidyverse">#tidyverse</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham">Hadley Wickham</a>, the high priest of the tidyverse himself, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3mp9r7/im_hadley_wickham_chief_scientist_at_rstudio_and/cvhl63u">said</a></p>

<p>If you want to give back, I think writing a blog is a great way. Many of the things that you struggle with will be common problems. Think about how to solve them well and describe your solution to others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, a lot of what I hope to be doing here is “describe [my] solution to others.” I also hope to write about computer science stuff in general, particularly as it relates to Java (my programming mother tongue!). Finally, I hope to write posts to accompany some of my past and future projects.</p>
